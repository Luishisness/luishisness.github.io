Klixel8 

PROS:
- Interactive Image
- Great for lifestyle images (ie a table or ilse full of food)
- Shopping on page
	-Or simply clicking into a picklist.
- Helps with overlaping divs on the front end architecture
	-Designs free flowing pages
- Fairly easy to set up on my end.


CONS:
- User experience is not intuitive 
	-have to click/press and hold to keep content box in place or scroll very quickly.
- Issues fetching Klixel8 data during prototype testing.
- Klixel8 fail loads a static image rendering the idea of Klixel8 taking up image space useless
- Image cannot take up full page (as with the built prototype)
	- No scrolling on klixel8 image.
- Asset update
	- Image needs to be relayered in order for klixel8 to register the new layer.
	- Code would need to be updated.

FD Challenges: 
- Cannot be used on the Wordpress blog
	-FD product data objects is not linked to blog
- Data issues in regards to store front:
	- Store front need access to full silo of FD product data objects to get the most use out of klixel8 software
	- Currenyly Product data for store front is only available on pages where the product lives
		-Taking this route causes reduncancy becuase the product is already on the FD loaded page
		-RTS centrals do not have access to any FD product object data. 
- Appdev involvemnet required for access to all fd product object data. 
- Design needs some training on how to use the photoshop portion.
	-Properly naming layers
	-Loading onto klixel8 server
